### Coming Soon
Booking Revision Feed will have a 30 Minute window to ack bookings, email will be sent if any unacked. Booking page will be updated to show ack status of bookings and you can sort by ack status. If you ack latest revision all prior revisions will be acked also. Please get in tough with us if these changes affect you, or you have any questions.

### Coming Soon
- Booking Revision Feed will have a 30 Minute window to ack revisions after you have received it once, email will be sent if any unacked revisions after 30 mins from created date. Any PMS downtime should be unaffected since we count from first receive of revision and not from creaded time.
- Vacation Rental properties will have limit on availability, if you set 1 available into the room settings you cant send 2 available. Hotel properties will have no restriction as now.

### Downtime Incedent 10-11 March 2022

#### Summary
- We had 4 hours downtime between 10:30pm & 2:30am where we could not process any ARI updates
- We have imported all booking & expedia missing reservations
- Other channels such as Agoda/Ctrip/hotelbeds etc the bookings must be handled manually, usually the OTA will send an email with booking details to the property

Please send a full sync from the PMS for all connected properties. Please reach out if you need any help
